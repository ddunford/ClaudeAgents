# Munero Project Specification

## Overview
A TypeScript-based autonomous build system that uses Claude's SDK to continuously analyze, build, test, and improve applications until they fully meet specifications. The system employs a sophisticated feedback loop to iteratively enhance both the specifications and implementation.

## Core Features

### 1. Dual Input System
- Direct prompt input for quick starts
- Structured specs directory (configurable via --specs)
- Automatic conversion of prompts to structured specs

### 2. Specification Enhancement
- Analysis of input specs or prompts
- Generation of machine-optimized specs in .munero/specs
- Continuous refinement based on implementation feedback
- Automatic documentation generation

### 3. Iterative Build System
- Continuous build-test-improve cycle
- Real-time validation against specs
- Automatic bug detection and fixing
- Performance optimization
- Security hardening
- Code quality improvements

### 4. Feedback Loop System
- Plan: Analyze current state and plan improvements
- Execute: Implement planned changes
- Observe: Monitor and test changes
- Reflect: Analyze results and impacts
- Re-plan: Adjust strategy based on learnings

### 5. Success Metrics
- Specification compliance rate
- Test coverage and pass rate
- Performance benchmarks
- Security audit results
- Code quality metrics
- Documentation completeness
- Integration test results

### 6. Agent Collaboration
- Pre-configured agents in .munero/agents
- Inter-agent communication
- Shared knowledge base
- Coordinated improvements

- API integration

### 4. State Management
- Build progress tracking
- Iteration history
- Success metrics
- Learning database
- Configuration management

### 5. Error Handling
- Graceful failure recovery
- Error analysis
- Automatic retry strategies
- State recovery
- Logging and monitoring
