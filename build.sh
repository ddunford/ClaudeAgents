# Use multiple MCP servers in coordination:

# Run Claude in interactive mode to properly utilize agents
echo "Using filesystem to read specs and write code, sequential-thinking for planning, and memory-bank for context retention, please carefully read all markdown files in ./src/specs and use the following process to generate high-quality production code:

1. First, use backend-architect to design the overall system architecture, APIs, and database schemas based on the specs in ./src/specs.
2. Then, based on the architectural decisions and requirements, use appropriate language specialist agents (typescript-pro, python-pro, golang-pro, etc.) to implement the services in ./src following the design patterns in CLAUDE.md.
3. Use cloud-architect to create necessary Docker and infrastructure configurations in ./src.
4. Use test-automator to implement the testing pyramid (80% unit, 15% integration, 5% E2E) aiming for 90% coverage, writing tests in ./src.
5. Finally, use security-auditor to review all code in ./src for security best practices.

Important requirements:
- Follow the microservices architecture defined in CLAUDE.md
- Use supabase for implementing database schemas and validation
- Use apidog for API documentation and testing
- Use github for code organization and PR reviews
- Ensure proper error handling and logging
- Add comprehensive documentation
- Follow the testing pyramid strategy
- Implement all security requirements (OAuth 2.0, AES256 encryption)
- Write all code and configuration files in the ./src directory
- Read specifications only from ./src/specs directory
- Choose appropriate language specialist agents based on architectural decisions and requirements

Please proceed step by step, ensuring each component is properly implemented before moving to the next." | claude --dangerously-skip-permissions
