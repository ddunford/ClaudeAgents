claude -p "Using filesystem to read specs and write code, sequential-thinking for planning, and memory-bank for context retention, please carefully read all markdown files in ./specs and use the following process to generate high-quality production code:

1. First, use backend-architect to design the overall system architecture, APIs, and database schemas based on the specs.
2. Then, use golang-pro and python-pro to implement the services following the design patterns in ../CLAUDE.md.
3. Use cloud-architect to create necessary Docker and infrastructure configurations.
4. Use test-automator to implement the testing pyramid (80% unit, 15% integration, 5% E2E) aiming for 90% coverage.
5. Finally, use security-auditor to review all code for security best practices.

Important requirements:
- Follow the microservices architecture defined in ../CLAUDE.md
- Use supabase for implementing database schemas and validation
- Use apidog for API documentation and testing
- Use github for code organization and PR reviews
- Ensure proper error handling and logging
- Add comprehensive documentation
- Follow the testing pyramid strategy
- Implement all security requirements (OAuth 2.0, AES256 encryption)

Please proceed step by step, ensuring each component is properly implemented before moving to the next."
