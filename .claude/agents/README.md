## Agent Format

Each agent follows this structure:
```markdown
---
name: agent-name
description: Clear description of when this agent should be used, with PROACTIVELY note for primary use cases
---

You are [role] specializing in [domain].

## Focus Areas
- Key capabilities and specialties
- Listed in bullet points

## Approach
1. Numbered steps for methodology
2. How the agent tackles problems
3. Key principles and practices

## Output
- What the agent produces
- Specific deliverables
- Expected results

Additional notes or special considerations.
```

## Usage

### Automatic Invocation
Claude Code will automatically delegate to the appropriate agent based on the task context and the agent's description.

### Explicit Invocation
You can mention the agent by name in your request:
```
"Use the code-reviewer to check my recent changes"
"Have the security-auditor scan for vulnerabilities"
"Get the performance-engineer to optimize this bottleneck"
```

## Agent Orchestration

Claude Code automatically coordinates agents using these patterns:

### Sequential Workflows
```
User Request ‚Üí Agent A ‚Üí Agent B ‚Üí Agent C ‚Üí Result

Example: "Build a new API feature"
backend-architect ‚Üí database-expert ‚Üí test-automator ‚Üí security-auditor
```

### Parallel Execution
```
User Request ‚Üí Agent A + Agent B (simultaneously) ‚Üí Merge Results

Example: "Optimize application performance" 
performance-engineer + database-expert ‚Üí Combined recommendations
```

### Review & Validation
```
Primary Agent ‚Üí Review Agent ‚Üí Final Result

Example: "Implement payment processing"
payment-integration ‚Üí security-auditor ‚Üí Validated implementation
```

## Best Practices

### üéØ Task Delegation
1. Let Claude Code delegate automatically - The system analyzes context and selects optimal agents
2. Be specific about requirements - Include constraints, tech stack, and quality requirements
3. Trust agent expertise - Each agent is optimized for their domain

### üîÑ Multi-Agent Workflows
1. Start with high-level requests - Let agents coordinate complex multi-step tasks
2. Provide context between agents - Ensure agents have necessary background information
3. Review integration points - Check how different agents' outputs work together

### üéõÔ∏è Explicit Control
1. Use explicit invocation for specific needs - When you want a particular expert's perspective
2. Combine multiple agents strategically - Different specialists can validate each other's work
3. Request specific review patterns - "Have security-auditor review backend-architect's API design"

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Agent not being invoked automatically:**
- Ensure your request clearly indicates the domain (e.g., "performance issue" ‚Üí performance-engineer)
- Be specific about the task type (e.g., "review code" ‚Üí code-reviewer)

**Unexpected agent selection:**
- Provide more context about your tech stack and requirements
- Use explicit invocation if you need a specific agent

**Multiple agents producing conflicting advice:**
- This is normal - different specialists may have different priorities
- Ask for clarification: "Reconcile the recommendations from security-auditor and performance-engineer"

**Agent seems to lack context:**
- Provide background information in your request
- Reference previous conversations or established patterns
