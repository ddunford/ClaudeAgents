# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We release patches for security vulnerabilities. Which versions are eligible for receiving such patches depends on the CVSS v3.0 Rating:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 0.1.x   | :white_check_mark: |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report (suspected) security vulnerabilities to security@yourdomain.com. You will receive a response from us within 48 hours. If the issue is confirmed, we will release a patch as soon as possible depending on complexity but historically within a few days.

## Disclosure Policy

When we receive a security bug report, we will:

1. Confirm the problem and determine the affected versions.
2. Audit code to find any potential similar problems.
3. Prepare fixes for all releases still under maintenance.
4. Release new versions of all affected releases.

## Security Update Process

1. Security report received and is assigned a primary handler.
2. Problem is confirmed and a list of all affected versions is determined.
3. Code is audited to find any potential similar problems.
4. Fixes are prepared for all releases still under maintenance.
5. Patches are applied to all affected versions in a private repository.
6. New versions are pushed to npm.
7. An announcement is made about the vulnerability.

## Comments on this Policy

If you have suggestions on how this process could be improved please submit a pull request.

## Security Best Practices

When using Munero, follow these security best practices:

1. **API Keys**
   - Never commit API keys to version control
   - Use environment variables for sensitive data
   - Rotate keys regularly

2. **Access Control**
   - Limit access to build artifacts
   - Use proper permissions for generated files
   - Implement role-based access control

3. **Dependencies**
   - Keep all dependencies up to date
   - Regularly run security audits
   - Use lockfiles to ensure dependency consistency

4. **Build Process**
   - Validate all inputs
   - Sanitize generated code
   - Implement proper error handling
   - Use secure defaults

5. **MCP Servers**
   - Configure servers with minimal permissions
   - Use secure communication channels
   - Monitor server activity

## Known Security Issues

We maintain a list of known security issues in our [Security Advisory](https://github.com/yourusername/munero/security/advisories) section.

## Security-Related Configuration

```typescript
const secureConfig = {
  validation: {
    security: "high",
    sanitization: true,
    auditLevel: "strict"
  },
  permissions: {
    fileSystem: "restricted",
    network: "minimal",
    execution: "controlled"
  }
};
```

## Automatic Security Checks

The build process includes automatic security checks:

1. Static Analysis
2. Dependency Scanning
3. Code Injection Detection
4. Input Validation
5. Output Sanitization
